                <h4>Inspiring Story of Lakshmi Agarwal - Acid attack Survivor</h4>
                <p>
                    <figure><img src="img/image.png" alt=" " style="float: right"></figure>
                    <h3>The Acid Assault</h3>
                    Laxmi Agarwal was born in New Delhi, on June 1, 1990. She was just a 15-year-old girl, in 7th grade, when she became the victim of a brutal act of revenge. Her attacker, Naeem Khan (32 years old), also called Guddu, threw acid on her in 2005 after she refused his proposal. One day, when she was passing through Khan Market, Delhi, Guddu and his brother’s girlfriend Rakhi, attacked her and left her unconscious on the street. 
                    
                    <h5>Confronting a Traumatizing Reality</h5>
                    Laxmi recalls that she was so traumatized that she did not look at her face in the mirror for 100 days. She even considered committing suicide, but she decided against it because of the agony she would bring her parents. The unconditional support of her parents never left her while she underwent 7 surgeries over the course of 7 years. The surgeries cost around 20 lakhs, with the financial help of her father’s employees at the time.
                    
                    Despite the various physical deformities, her mental health also suffered as she faced taunts and hate from society. Some people also went as far as questioning her upbringing and blaming her for the attack, she recalls.

                    <h5>The Battle Against the Dark Days</h5>
                    Laxmi Agarwal refused to let this unjust and heinous crime, navigate her life and started to pursue a diploma. Despite the criticism and constant backlash, she completed her diploma in Vocational Training from the National Institute of Open Schooling with the help of her professors and peers.
                    
                    With her parents standing by her as her pillars of strength, she took her case against Naeem Khan to the court. Guddu was condemned to 10 years in prison after a four-year trial, while Rakhi was sentenced to seven years in prison.
                    
                    She also filed a PIL in the Supreme Court that received 27k signatures, seeking new laws and amendments that dealt with acid attack crimes, and also demanded a ban on the sale of acid. In July 2013, the Supreme Court issued decisions that resulted in the restriction of acid sales, compensation for victims, aftercare, and rehabilitation of survivors, limited government compensation, reservation in educational institutions, and better access to jobs.
                    
                    Acid attack survivors in India are now given rights under the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.
                    
                    <h5>Breaking the Social Stigma </h5>
                    She relentlessly worked to bring awareness and shed light on the necessary discussion of acid attacks in India, which led to the establishment of the Chhanv foundation in 2014, which assisted acid attack survivors with rehabilitation, medical and legal aid, counselling, job opportunities, etc.
                    Through the medium of her foundation, Laxmi Agarwal now counsels the patients on the right procedures to follow in case of an attack. She even encourages the public to donate skin.
                    Her cafe ‘Sheroes Hangout’, at Fatehabad Road of Agra, began to employ acid attack victims and provided livelihood opportunities, to work towards boosting the confidence of the survivors, to normalize interacting in the open, without hiding their faces, and to sensitize the issue further.</p>
